    <h2 style="color: #28B463;">Android Animation</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Adding animations to your app interface will give high quality feel to your android applications.
            Animations are especially useful when the screen changes state, such as when content loads or new actions become available.
            Animations can also add a polished look to your app, which gives your app a higher quality feel.</p>
