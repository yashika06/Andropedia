            This would be entire project context. Whatever you do in IntelliJ IDEA, you do that in the context of a project. A project is an organizational unit that represents a complete software solution. A project in Android Studio is like a workspace in Eclipse. In android Studio a project, can contain multiple modules.

            Eclipse uses project.properties file for project specific metadata. Here in android studio, this .idea does the same thing. This means the project specific metadata is stored by Android Studio.

            <li>
                <b>libs: </b> This is a commonly seen folder in eclipse land too, which optionally can hold the libraries or .jar files.

The main folder contains two subfolders java and res. The java folder contains all the java codes and res contains drawables, layouts, etc.
