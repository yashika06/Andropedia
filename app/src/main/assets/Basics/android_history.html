    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The smartphone has come a long way since the first iPhone was launched in 2007, there’s no denying that Google’s Android is by far the most popular. Of course, “Android” as a whole hasn’t stayed the same over the years — it has evolved significantly since its inception, first being released on a HTC Dream T-Mobile G1 device back in Oct, 2008.</p>

            Android was first created in 2003 by Andy Rubin, who first started developing the OS for digital cameras. Soon, he realized that the market for digital camera operating systems perhaps wasn’t all that big, and Android, Inc. diverted its attention toward smartphones.

        <p>It wasn’t until 2005 that Google purchased Android, Inc., and while not much about Android was known at the time, many took it as a signal that Google would use the platform to enter the phone business. Eventually, Google did enter the smartphone business — but not as a hardware manufacturer. Instead, it marketed Android to other manufacturers, first catching the eye of HTC, who used the platform for the first Android phone, the HTC Dream.</p>
