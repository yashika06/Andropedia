    <h2 style="color: #28B463;">Pending Intent</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
        A PendingIntent is an object that wraps up an intent object and it specifies an action to be taken place in future.
        In other words, it lets us pass a future Intent to another application and allow that application to execute that Intent
        as if it had the same permissions as our application, whether or not our application is still around when the Intent is eventually invoked.</p>
        <p>PendingIntent uses the following methods to handle the different types of intents:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ulist">
        <ul>
            <li>PendingIntent.getActivity() : Retrieve a PendingIntent to start an Activity</li>
            <li>PendingIntent.getBroadcast() : Retrieve a PendingIntent to perform a Broadcast</li>
            <li>PendingIntent.getService() : Retrieve a PendingIntent to start a Service</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
        <pre>
                        Intent intent = new Intent(this, SomeActivity.class);
                        PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 1, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT);
                        try {
                            pendingIntent.send();
                        } catch (PendingIntent.CanceledException e) {
                            e.printStackTrace();
                        }
        </pre>
    </div>
    <div class="ulist">
        The parameters inside the getActivity() method and there usages are described below :

        this (context) : This is the context in which the PendingIntent starts the activity
        requestCode :
        intent : Explicit intent object of the activity to be launched
        flag : One of the PendingIntent flag that we’ve used in the above example is FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT. This one states that if a previous PendingIntent already exists, then the current one will update it with the latest intent. There are many other flags like FLAG_CANCEL_CURRENT etc.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>this (context): </b> This is the context in which the PendingIntent starts the activity.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>requestCode:</b> “1” is the private request code for the sender used in the above example.
                Using it later with the same method again will get back the same pending intent.
                Then we can do various things like cancelling the pending intent with cancel(), etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>intent: </b>  Explicit intent object of the activity to be launched
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>flag: </b> One of the PendingIntent flag that we’ve used in the above example is FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT.
                This one states that if a previous PendingIntent already exists, then the current one will update it with the latest intent.
            </li>
