    <h2 style="color: #28B463;">Broadcast Receiver</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>A broadcast receiver is an Android component which allows you to register for system or application events.
            Android apps can send or receive broadcast messages from the Android system and other Android apps. </p>
        <p>For example, applications can register for the ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED system event which is fired once the Android system has completed the boot process.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 style="color: #28B463;">Implementation</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>A receiver can be registered via the AndroidManifest.xml file. Alternatively to this static registration,
            you can also register a receiver dynamically via the Context.registerReceiver() method.</p>
        <p>The implementing class for a receiver extends the BroadcastReceiver class. If the event for which the broadcast receiver
            has registered happens, the onReceive() method of the receiver is called by the Android system.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 style="color: #28B463;">Pending Intent</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>A pending intent is a token that you give to another application. This allows the other application to restore the
            permissions of your application to execute a predefined piece of code.</p>
        <p>To perform a broadcast via a pending intent, get a PendingIntent via the getBroadcast() method of the PendingIntent class.
            To perform an activity via a pending intent, you receive the activity via PendingIntent.getActivity().</p>
