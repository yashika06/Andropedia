        <p>A Fragment represents a behavior or a portion of user interface in an Activity. You can combine multiple fragments in a single activity and reuse a fragment in multiple activities.
            Interaction with fragments is done through FragmentManager. Fragments represents a particular operation or interface that is running within a larger Activity.</p>
        <p>Though Fragment defines its own lifecycle, that lifecycle is dependent on its activity: if the activity is stopped,
            no fragments inside of it can be started; when the activity is destroyed, all fragments will be destroyed.</p>
        <p>For example, if in an application if we want to display a list of items with details associated with them.
        We would compose the activityâ€™s view from a list fragment and a detail fragment. The detail view would
            show the details of the selected list item. The activity will replace the detail fragment with another detail fragment
        when a new list item is selected.</p>
