    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>A content provider manages access to a central repository of data. If we want to share data with other applications we
            can use a content provider. Provider offer data encapsulation based on URIâ€™s.
            Any URI which starts with content:// points to a resources which can be accessed via a provider.</p>

        <p>Typically we work with content providers in one of two scenarios; we may want to implement code to access an
            exiting content provider in another application, or we may want to create a new content provider in our application to share data with other applications.</p>
