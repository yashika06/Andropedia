    <h2 style="color: #28B463;">Accessing a provider</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>To access data in a content provider, you use the ContentResolver object in your application's Context to communicate with the provider as a client.
            The ContentResolver object communicates with the provider object, an instance of a class that implements ContentProvider</p>
        <p>A common pattern for accessing a ContentProvider from your UI uses a CursorLoader to run an asynchronous query in the background.
            The Activity or Fragment in your UI call a CursorLoader to the query, which in turn gets the ContentProvider using the ContentResolver. </p>
        <p>To access a provider, your application usually has to request specific permissions in its manifest file. </p>

        <p>The following lines of code show a ContentResolver.query() call:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
        <pre>
                        mCursor = getContentResolver().query(
                        content_uri,   // The content URI of the words table
                        mProjection,                        // The columns to return for each row
                        mSelectionClause                    // Selection criteria
                        mSelectionArgs,                     // Selection criteria
                        mSortOrder);                        // The sort order for the returned rows
        </pre>
    </div>
    <h2 style="color: #28B463;">Content URI</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>A content URI is a URI that identifies data in a provider.
            Content URIs include the symbolic name of the entire provider (its authority) and a name that points to a table (a path).</p>
        <p>For ex, content://user_dictionary/words, where the user_dictionary string is the provider's authority, and the words string is the table's path.
            The string content:// (the scheme) is always present, and identifies this as a content URI.</p>
