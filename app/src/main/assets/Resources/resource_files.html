            Resource files must be placed in the /res directory of your application in a predefined sub-folder.
            The specific sub-folder depends on type of resource which is stored. You can also append additional qualifiers to the folder name. These are called resource qualifiers.
            These qualifiers indicate that the related resources should be used for special device configurations.
