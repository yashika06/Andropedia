            R.java file is an auto-generated file by Android Asset Packaging Tool that contains resource IDs for all the resources of
            res/ directory. when you create any component in the xml file, id for the corresponding component is automatically created
            in this file. This id can be used in the activity source file to perform any action on the component.
        </p>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
            If you add a new resource file, the corresponding reference is automatically created in a R.java file.
            Manual changes in the R.java file are not necessary and will be overwritten by the tooling.
            The Android system provides methods to access the corresponding resource files via these IDs.

            example, to
            access a
            String with the
            <code>R.string.yourString</code>
            ID in your source code,
            you would use the
            <code>getString(R.string.yourString)</code>
            method defined on the
            <code>Context</code>
            class.</p>
