    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>A Service is an application component that can perform long-running operations in the background,
            and it does not provide a user interface. For example, a service can handle network transactions, play music, perform file I/O,
            or interact with a content provider, all from the background.</p>
        <p>There are three different types of services: </p>
    </div>
    <div class="ulist">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Scheduled: </b>A service is scheduled when an API such as the JobScheduler, launches the service.</li>
            <li><b>Started: </b>A service is started when an application component calls startService().
                After it's started, a service can run in the background indefinitely, even if the component that started it is destroyed.</li>
            <li><b>Bound: </b>A service is bound when an application component binds to it by calling bindService().
                A bound service offers a client-server interface that allows components to interact with the service,
                 send requests, receive results, and even do so across processes with interprocess communication (IPC). </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>To create a service, we must create a subclass of Service or use one of its existing subclasses.
            In our implementation, we must override some callback methods that handle key aspects of the service lifecycle</p>
