    <h2 style="color: #28B463;">Activity Lifecycle</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The Activity class provides a number of callbacks that allow the activity to know that a state has changed: that the system is creating, stopping, or resuming an activity, or destroying the process in which the activity resides.</p>
        <p>An activity has essentially four states:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ulist">
        <ul>
            <li>If an activity is in the foreground of the screen (at the top of the stack), it is active or running.</li>
            <li>If an activity has lost focus but is still visible (that is, a new non-full-sized or transparent activity has focus on top of your activity), it is paused. A paused activity is completely alive </li>
            <li>If an activity is completely obscured by another activity, it is stopped. It still retains all state and member information, however, it is no longer visible to the user</li>
            <li>If an activity is paused or stopped, the system can drop the activity from memory by either asking it to finish, or simply killing its process.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The following diagram shows the important state paths of an Activity. </p>

    <h2 style="color: #28B463;">Callback Methods</h2>
    <div class="ulist">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>onCreate(): </b> This method is called when the activity is first created. This is where you should do all of your normal static set up: create views, bind data to lists, etc. This method also provides you with a Bundle containing the activity's previously frozen state.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>onStart(): </b> This method is called when the activity enters the Started state.
                The onStart() method completes very quickly and the activity does not stay resident in the Started state. Once this callback finishes, the activity enters the Resumed state.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>onResume(): </b> This method is called when the activity enters the Resumed state and it comes to the foreground.
                This is the state in which the app interacts with the user. The app stays in this state until something happens to take focus away from the app.
                When an interruptive event occurs, the activity enters the Paused state.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>onPause(): </b> The system calls this method as the first indication that the user is leaving current activity.
                We can use the onPause() method to release system resources, such as broadcast receivers, handles to sensors, etc.
                Implementations of this method must be very quick because the next activity will not be resumed until this method returns.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>onStop(): </b> When current activity is no longer visible to the user, it has entered the Stopped state,
                and the system invokes the onStop() callback. This may occur when a newly launched activity covers the entire screen.
                In the onStop() method, the app should release almost all resources that aren't needed while the user is not using it.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>onDestroy(): </b> This method is called before the activity is destroyed.
                The system may also call this method when an orientation change occurs, and then immediately call onCreate() to recreate the process in the new orientation.
                The onDestroy() callback releases all resources that have not yet been released by earlier callbacks such as onStop().
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>onRestart(): </b> This method is called when the activity restarts after stopping. This method is always followed by onStart().
            </li>

        </ul>
