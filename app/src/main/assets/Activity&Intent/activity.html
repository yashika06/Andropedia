    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Activities are one of the fundamental building blocks of apps on the Android platform. Activity represent a single
        screen with which the user can interact. Android system initiates its program with in an Activity starting with a call on onCreate() callback method.</p>
        <p>An activity facilitates the following key interactions between system and app:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ulist">
        <ul>
            <li>Keeping track of what the user currently cares about to ensure that the system keeps running the process that is hosting the activity.</li>
            <li>Helping the app handle having its process killed so the user can return to activities with their previous state restored.</li>
            <li>Providing a way for apps to implement user flows between each other, and for the system to coordinate these flows. </li>
        </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Activities in the system are managed as an activity stack. When a new activity is started, it is placed on the top of the stack and becomes the running activity.
        The previous activity always remains below it in the stack, and will not come to the foreground again until the new activty exits.</p>
