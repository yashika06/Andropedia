    <h2 style="color: #28B463;">Implicit Intent</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Implicit Intents does not specify a component; instead, they must
            include enough information for the system to determine which of the available components is best to run for that intent.
            This is handled by the process of Intent resolution, which maps an Intent to an Activity, BroadcastReceiver, or Service that can handle it.</p>
        <p> For example, if you want to show the user a location on a map, you can use an implicit intent to request that another capable app show a specified location on a map.</p>
        <p>An Intent object carries information that the Android system uses to determine which component to start, plus information that the recipient component uses in order to properly perform the action </p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
        <pre>
                        Intent intent = new Intent();
                        intent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
                        intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, message);
                        intent.setType("text/plain");
                        startActivity(intent);
        </pre>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>When startActivity() is called, the system examines all of the installed apps to determine which ones can handle this kind of intent.
            If there's only one app that can handle it, that app opens immediately and if multiple activities accept the intent, the system displays a dialog so the user can pick which app to use.</p>
