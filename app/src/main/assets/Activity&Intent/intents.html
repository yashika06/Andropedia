    <h2 style="color: #28B463;">Intents</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
       <p>An intent is an abstract description of an operation to be performed. An Intent provides a facility for performing late runtime binding between the code in different applications. Although intents facilitate communication between components in several ways, there are three fundamental use cases: </p>
    </div>
    <div class="ulist">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Starting an activity: </b><br>
                We can start a new instance of an Activity by passing an Intent to startActivity(). The Intent describes the activity to start and carries any necessary data.
                <div class="listingblock">
                    <pre>
                        Intent intent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, NextActivity.class);
                        intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT,"hello");
                        startActivity(intent);
                    </pre>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Starting a service: </b><br>
                We can start a service to perform a one-time operation (such as downloading a file) by passing an Intent to startService(). The Intent describes the service to start and carries any necessary data.
                <div class="listingblock">
                    <pre>
                        Intent intent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, HelloService.class);
                        startService(intent);
                    </pre>
                </div>
                If the service is designed with a client-server interface, we can bind to the service from another component by passing an Intent to bindService().
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Delivering a broadcast: </b>
                A broadcast is a message that any app can receive. The system delivers various broadcasts for system events,
                such as when the system boots up or the device starts charging.
                We can deliver a broadcast to other apps by passing an Intent to sendBroadcast() or sendOrderedBroadcast().
                <div class="listingblock">
                    <pre>
                        Intent intent = new Intent();
                        intent.setAction("com.android.Broadcast");
                        intent.putExtra("extra", phoneNo);
                        sendBroadcast(intent);
                    </pre>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
